## About the Project  
This project helped me learn three-tiered application development.  I enjoyed MySQL database design and schema development.  Also, we leveraged a home-grown ORM to abstract the DB details. I learned a lot about MVC with Express, such as Route handlers to call controllers which pulled models from the database.  Models were databound to views using handlebars.
